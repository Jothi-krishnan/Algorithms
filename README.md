# Algorithms
Hello Everyone!!!

I am Jothi Krishnan M, a fresher in the ECE department of IIT Roorkee. I have just started to learn Algorithms as a part of my course. 
So, I have decided to learn from the site- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm  , understand the process and then write the code myself in c++.

I don't know how long it's going to take, but I emphasis on quality over quantity.
